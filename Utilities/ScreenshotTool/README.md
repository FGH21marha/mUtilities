This handly little tool makes it super simple to set up cameras to render screenshots of your work. It uses screenshot profiles for camera setups and folder locations. If you want two different screenshot locations with differing camera settings, positions and more you can do so with ease!

Install:
1. Clone or download the ScreenshotTool repo and unzip it.
2. Import the unzipped folder into your unity project

NOTE: this plugin requires mArray and mEditor to function properly, if you do not have these installed either you must do so in order to use this tool.
